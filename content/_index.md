The assumptions underlying statistical analysis are rarely fully met. Pragmatists face the challenge of knowing when evidence is strong enough to justify action, and thatâ€™s where **sensitivity analysis** helps by testing the robustness of inferences against potential biases. For instance, sensitivity indices can quantify how much of the observed effect would need to be bias-driven to alter conclusions. We are building on these ideas by developing the methods and associated resources listed on this page.
