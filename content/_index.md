**Space still available for hybrid ICPSR course (July 8-12, 2024): “Sensitivity Analysis: Quantifying the Robustness of Inferences to Alternative Factors or Data."** (Modalities: virtual or in-person in Ann Arbor, MI, with asynchronous access to materials)

Most social scientists need to consider the unobserved conditions that could change an inference. This workshop is about the statistical tools (R,  Stata or the [konfound-it app](https://konfound-project.shinyapps.io/konfound-it/) to do just that, quantifying the strength of evidence to inform policy, practice, or general social science.

This workshop is a full 20 instruction hours elaborating on the March 21 talk "Sensitivity Analysis for Quantifying the Robustness of Causal Inference" given by [Ken Frank](https://education.msu.edu/people/frank-kenneth/).
