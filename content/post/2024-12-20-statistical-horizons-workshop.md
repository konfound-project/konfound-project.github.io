### About this Seminar

This seminar provides hands-on experience with two techniques for quantifying the sensitivity of causal inferences: Robustness of Inference to Replacement (RIR) and Impact Threshold for a Confounding Variable (ITCV). These techniques can be adapted to a range of analyses, including logistic regression, propensity-based approaches, and multilevel models. You'll learn to apply and understand these techniques and conduct sensitivity analyses in R, Stata, or the on-line app https://konfound-project.shinyapps.io/konfound-it/. Designed for researchers, policymakers, and clinicians, this seminar equips you with the skills to address challenges to an inference and strengthen discourse around causal evidence.
